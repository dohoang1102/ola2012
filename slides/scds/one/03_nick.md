I am an odd duck.

I don't really fit in anywhere, but I fit in everywhere?

.notes A position like mine does not fit perfectly into any single traditional library department. I like to joke that I have a lot of feet since I have a foot in nearly every department. I have a natural connection to IT given the tech behind most of what I do. But, at its heart, digital collections/preservation is just another form of collection development. I've bounced around a few departments over my time at Mac, but I think I have finally found a home in the centre. It is the best possible scenario at this point.

# INFRASTRUCTURE #

* Digitization
* Digital Respository
* Digital Preservation

.notes one of my standard phases at work is INFRASTRUCTURE! Given that when I started at Mac there was nearly zero infrastructure for digitization or repository structure, we had to basically start from scratch. Over the last few years we have built some decent infrastructure for digitization. We have a hosted institutional repository from Bepress (DigitalCommons) and we have the begun the work of building a solid local digital repository with Fedora Commons and Islandora. We're also slowly working on policy and best practices for digital preservation.

# Digitization #

* Local projects
  * Jewish Underground Resistance collection
  * World War, 1939-1945, German Concentration Camps and Prisons collection
  * Peace and War in the 20th Century
  * Historical Perspectives on Canadian Publishing
  * Masters and PhD theses
  * Book scanning

.notes Digitization is one thing we are *really* good at. We have digitized an insane amount of materials over the last few years. But, the problem is a lot of it isn't publically available. This should begin to change very soon with the new digital repository. These are some local projects we have completed or are still ongoing. talk about each project briefly.

# Digitization #

* Partnerships
  * Adam Matthews
    * World War I collections (~20k objects)
  * Gale
    * Holocaust and Jewish Resistance materials (~26k objects)
    * Pamphlet collections (starts in Febuary 2012

.notes besides or local projects, we have partnered with a couple of vendors to digitize entire collections. Normally hearing the word vendor partnership is something I would immediately scoff at, but these partnerships are not too bad when you think about them. talk about each partnership briefly.

# Digitization #

* Challenges
  * Growing fast
  * Infrastructure
  * Public
  * Repository
  * Digital Preservation
  * Staffing

.notes As I previously touched on, in terms of digitization we have grown very quickly. This has caused a number of issues in regards to infrastrutre. Yes, we may have scanned a couple thousand books - but are they publically available? NO. What is needed is a health balance between digitization and infrastructure. What I mean by infrastructure is having a repository to put all this stuff and make it publicly available. Thousands upons thousands of digital objects sitting on a storage arrays is of no use to anybody, and presents any number of issues in regards to digital preservation. What is truly needed is proper staffing, hardware infrastructure, and repository platform combined with some robust workflows and policy. None of which is easy in a spartan environment.

  * Code
* THE COMMUNITY IS YOUR BEST FRIEND!

.notes I don't have time to go into a full blown digital preservation talk here, so I will keep it really brief. At its heart, digital preservation is a series or organizational changes. Your organization must be commited to these changes in practice else all will be for naught. So, basically there will be a lot of documentation. Document everything you do. Documention every change to a object, and transaction with that object. Policy-wise, all of your digital preservation practices must be tied to some sort of organization policy. Something to fall back on. And, as for the technical stuff, you need a solid infrastructure. A repository, and microservices to take care of the tedious nitty-gritty stuff like automatically converting tifs to jpeg2000s upon ingest. There is a wonderful community around all of this, and it is without a doubt your bestfriend.

#Education & Knowledge Sharing #

* Ingest
* Digital Preservation
* Harvesting
* Metadata
* Best practices
* Project management
* Version control

.notes Policy on what is required to ingest a collection into the repository - this is minumum requirements for objects and associated metadata. Consulting on best practices for digital preservation for a project, our us taking ownership of the objects. Harvesting - knowledge sharing about what harvesting is, and what can be done with it. Metadata - best practices, and guidance for setting up metadata requirements for a project. Best practices is just a catch all for everything that doesn't neatly fall into one of these areas. Project management - Guidance and knowledge sharing on project management. We've all had our hands in a number of projects, and lead our fair share. Here we share our best practices and can provide a sort of mentoring role, or actual project lead. Version control - John touched on this earlier, but we are huge version control advocates, specifically git. We can provide a lot of support and guidance in transitioning a project to version control, or from another system to git, or just the odd git question.
